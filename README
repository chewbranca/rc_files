This is my collection of rc files. This is a random collection of
functions, aliases and settings I've stumbled upon. I searched 
through a lot of the old dotfiles.org site cherry picky configs
that I like.

I would also like to incorporate settings from:
http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/sample-bashrc.html

So far I have added in my work in progress bash config.

I recommend just cloning this to your home directory and then
symlinking everything in.

From the initial commit:

    This is still pretty ugly and needs some work, but it has a hand-
    ful of nice aliases and functions. The prompt still needs work.
    I like seeing jobs and the git repo in the prompt, but it needs
    to be cleaned up and has a lot of room for improvement.
